## Description
This repository contains the code for my portfolio website, which serves as a showcase of my projects and reflects my ongoing development journey. Through this website, I aim to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have acquired in web development, particularly utilising the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

I have built this portfolio as a platform to continuously update and improve as I progress in my career. It represents my dedication to honing my programming abilities and serves as a testament to my passion for web development.

By continually refining and expanding this website, I strive to create a valuable resource to exhibit my work to potential clients and employers. It not only displays the projects I have completed but also showcases the growth and expertise I have gained through research, learning, and practical application.
